### Step 1: Research & Inspiration
Design considerations:
    - Clean: drive viewers toward content, don't distract. Remember it's also an example of your work!
    - Navigation: Don't clutter the main menu
    - Logo/Tagline: Quick short phrase, who are you, detail without volume (New York based developer better than developer)
    - Call to action: What's the purpose of the portfolio (get employed! ðŸ¤ž)
    - Services: skills? What can I do for a client/future employer?
    - Contact information (LinkdIn?)
    - Myself: My story
    - Personal Projects/Case Studies: Don't just present the project, talk about the experience

Tech considerations:
    - React
    - Accessibility: Aria?
    - SEO
    - Responsive/mobile friendly (https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
        - https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/get-started?utm_campaign=mobile-friendly&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=wmc-blog


Things to think about including:
- Testimonials? Feedback from other Bootcampers?
- Images? Stock images to jazz things up?
- Logo and/or picture of me

### Step 2: Tech Choices 
Component libraries considered:
- Ant Design: https://ant.design/
- Chakra: https://chakra-ui.com/
- Semantic UI: https://react.semantic-ui.com/
- Material UI: https://mui.com/ 
- Mantine: https://mantine.dev/

I've used Chakra in the past and I liked it a lot, and was very tempted to use it in this project. However, discussing component libraries with my mentor introduced me Mantine, which I was excited to try out.
